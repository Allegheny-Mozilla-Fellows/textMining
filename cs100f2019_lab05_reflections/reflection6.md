I am going to manipulate the DNA String: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The complement of AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA is TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
Inserting a letter at 24
AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCACGGA
Deletion of DNA at 20
AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGTCAGGA
Changing positions at 11
AAGTCTGGGCCATAATCCAGATCAGGA
Thank you for using Manipulate DNA. Have a great day!
```

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: consetetur sadipscing elitr
- `length`: stores the lenght of how long the DNA is
- `toUpperCase`: scans line and converts to upper case


## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
Overall this was, in my opinion, one of the more challenging labs and it took some time to get through so that it would build and run smoothly. One of the main struggles that I faced was the construction the code which was responsible for the randomization and construction of integers. During classes this was a similar issue and I sought to find a way to better understand it. First I attempted to solves this problem with my own knowledge. I followed by looking over all notes, slides, and looking at sections of the textbook that would help me find a solution. Once this failed, I sought to find a teacher's assistant with a better understanding. With their help, I was able to understand the errors I was making and correct them so that my program could run smoothly.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
The people who tend to be responsible for constructing the genome editing technology are the researchers and bioethicists.
2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
The users of the genome editing technology are most commonly scientists and researchers who are collaborating to make changes to the DNA.
3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Editing genome cells should not be allowed by the common/uncertified people and also those who have not obtained legal access to the program.
4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
If not done correctly, distortion's in the DNA could be made which will ultimately affect the human themselves.
5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
The best way to avoid harm in my opinion is to continue carefully continue to do work on the editing programs to assure that there will be no issues or complications. There is no reason that this program should ever be utilized if there isn't absolute certainty of its success because of the catastrophic conclusions mistakes could lead to.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
After taking the time to complete the lab through a trial and error process, I felt there were a couple of tasks that definitely required some refining. One being I had difficulty with the construction of randomizing integers. After a couple attempts to complete the process on my own, I acquired some assistance. I got into contact with a teacher's assistant who helped me figure out the mistakes that I was making and explained the ways which I would be able to improve. Only then was I able to accurately accomplish this section on the lab. I would most certainly require and desire further practice with integers and randomizing in general. This way I will be a lot more confident and be able to do these tasks with little difficulty.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
This lab tackled a variety of topics we have covered in class and there is no short of options which I appreciated. One thing that stands out however, isn't technically a topic which we covered in class. I felt a new appreciation for doing labs with a teammate. Despite some of the issues and difficulties that come with collaboration, in the end, it makes a huge difference to have another person assisting with their skills, work and knowledge. All of these things allow for the lab to be completed much quicker and easier. Especially a lab with such a variety of content and code, having a teammate with whom the the load can be shared. If we did more labs similar this one in the future, I would definitely want to collaborate my efforts with that of another classmate.
