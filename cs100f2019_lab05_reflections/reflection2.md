The DNA strand is AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The complement DNA strand is TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The random position is 13
Letter one is T
Performing an insertion mutation gives TTCAGACCCGGAATTTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The random position is 22
Letter two is A
Performing a deletion mutation gives TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTATCCT
The random position is 9
Letter three is C
Performing a random mutation gives TTCAGACCCCGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
Thank you for using the program Manipulate DNA. Have a nice day!

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `rand.nextInt`: gives a random number ranging across all integer values positive and negative
- `.substring`: gives a string that is a substring of the particular string
- `charAt`: gives a character at the specified index


## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge that I faced was getting the program to run and build successfully. This lab was very difficult in matching up variables and inserting and deleting a random letter. It was not clear how to go about this and I think I was making it more complicated than it needed to be. It was also challenging to get the variables to match up in terms of String, int, and char in order for the program to build successfully. Overall it was difficult performing the three mutations and writing the correct commands to get the desired output.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?

The people making gene editing technology are researchers in the biology and genetics field as well as bioethicists to make sure the process does not become out of hand and cross ethical boundaries.

2.Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

The users of genome editing technology are prospective parents with a disease that is known to be passed onto any child they would have. In some cases genome editing is being used for therapy which borders on enhancement of the genome.

3.Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

People using genome editing for enhancement purposes should not be using it because it borders on how ethical it is. This would be especially concerning in parents attempting to use genome editing for reproductive purposes and basically creating a child.

4.How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

The genome editing technology can cause harm by having side effects or off-target effects in which edits occur in the wrong position. Harm could also be caused by genome editing technology being offered to only a select group of people.

5.What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?

Some solutions that can be developed to avoid harm or fix the harm are conducting more research and not offering it to a selective group of people. More research needs to be done especially in terms of embryos. In addition, if germline editing is only offered to a select group of people, the wealthy, it will be problematic for the class system.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

One task that I would like to practice more after completing this assignment is using the random class commands and using letters in random commands rather than numbers. I think choosing a random number somewhat makes sense, but assigning random positions and then random letters is a little more difficult and a type of command I would like to practice more.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

A learning experience that I valued the most after completing this assignment is that a lot of trial and error goes into making sure everything is running correctly. I rewrote the commands and played with different variables so many times that it was frustrating, but a valuable takeaway experience.
