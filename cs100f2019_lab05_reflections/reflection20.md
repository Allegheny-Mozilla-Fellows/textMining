Okay, I am going to manipulate the DNA String: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The complement of AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA is TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
Inserting a letter at 21
AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGAATCAGGA
Deletion of character at 12
AAGTCTGGGCCTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Changing positions of characters at 10
AAGTCTGGGCGTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Thank you for using Manipulate DNA program. Have a good day.

```

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: will display the next integer that will is implemented or inserted
- `println`: displays string and code in terminal
- `int position`: does an action to a specific character in a particular position of a string


## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge that I faced was figuring out how to actually write a piece of code that would work. This may sound dumb, but the hardest part of this lab assignment for me at least, was to look what was wrong with each part of the code I was typing and fix the issue. In my opinion, this was the toughest and most complicated lab we have done in this class thus far. This lab assignment took into account a bunch of different skills that we have learned in the recent weeks. We had to use the random class along with the for loops and scanner methods. These are all things that we learned in class and through practicals, but we just have not gotten a lot of time to work on these skills. While we have not mastered these various skills in this class yet, practicing like this in a lab assignment is the only way that we are going to learn it and hopefully get better overall as a programmer. Yes, my challenge is very broad and an overarching theme but I just feel like I need to better my computer science skills so that it is easier to know when and where to use a certain method or technique. I simply conquered these challenges by referring back to the practicals and class documents that we reviewed in class. These helped me by providing an example and being a resource sop that I could mirror the same technique in my source code.   


## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
The people that make the genome editing technology are referred to as researchers and bioethicists.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Scientists and research groups that work together in order to edit the DNA to how they want it.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
People that are not supposed to use the genome editing technology are normal citizens and people that do not have legal access or are not certified to use the science.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
The genome editing can cause major harm because if some cells do not receive the same edit as the other cells, then the cells will obviously not be the same and there will be a distortion in the DNA and ultimately the human.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
One solution is to just keep studying and testing the genome editing functions. This genome editing science needs to be full-proof in order to start using it in everyday life so one way to work out the kinks is to just practice using it.


## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

After completing this lab assignment, one task that I want to practice more is the randomization tool. I just feel as if I am not as good as I should be when using that type of code. I feel like I always have to look back in my class documents or the professor’s slides in order to know how to use it properly. It is a relatively easy tool to use but I just can’t wrap my head around it and I think I just need some more practice.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

One learning experience I valued the most after this lab is using a “for loop”. I have little to no experience when it comes to using for loops in my code and we just recently learned how to and when to use them and so it was very cool getting the chance to use it and implement it myself.
