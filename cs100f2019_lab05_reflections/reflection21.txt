I'm going to manipulate the DNA sequence: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA


Original: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA

Complement: TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT

Insertion: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGACTCAGGA
        The Letter C was inserted after position 21

Deletion: AAGTCTGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
        The Letter G was removed from position 8

Replacement: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCATATCAGGA
        The Letter G was replaced with T, at position 19


Thank you for using the DNA Manipulation program, have a wonderful day!

## String and Random Methods

- `dna`: The original DNA string
- `dna1`: The complement DNA string
- `dna2`: The insertion DNA string
- `dna3`: The deletion DNA string
- `dna4`: The replacement DNA string
- `randLetters`: A string randomly selected from to get a letter for insertion or replacement
- `rand`: A random method that is re-used throughout the program to generate random values
- `removed`: A string that stored the letter that was removed from the dna3 string

## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge I encountered was generating the DNA complement. I overcame this by
converting the dna string into a char array, and nesting if statements within a while loop to evaluate and modify
each character individually.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
Computer scientist and biologists

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Scientists and researchers

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
The general populace

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
Through off=target effects, and mosaicism

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
Regulation and further research

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I would like to practice more with the scanner utility, because I find the commands to be un-intuitive and I am not confident
in my ability to utilize more advanced scanner functions.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I valued my learning experience with arrays and conversion the most, because in java strings are immutable, and converting them into
char arrays provides much more freedom when manipulating strings.
