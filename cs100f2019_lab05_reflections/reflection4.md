Your chosen DNA is AAGTCT
This is first dna TTGTCT
This is second dna AAGACA
This is third dna AACTCT
This is fourth dna AAGTGT
The letter I am inserting is AA
Your random chosen DNA is AA
Deleted dna is AGTCT
Changed the random dna is AAAGTCT
Thank you for manipulating DNA!

```

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: read the number in a next line
- `next`: read the first word in a next line
- `toUpperCase`: Make the word all capitalized


## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

Technical Challenge I faced was to understand the sequence of coding. In my opinion, this lab was little bit longer than other labs we worked. Therefore, it was complicated to follow the instruction such as printing out the code and changing the DNA into different version. We have to make a change in the same DNA every section which confused me to use different coding. I thought we should make a change in the last version of DNA, so I was coding in the last product of DNA and it was showing error. Then, I went to TA's office hours and figured out the problem. It was great experience to challenge myself and learn the manipulation.


## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
Bioethicists and researchers believe that it should continue as long as it is safe.  

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
People who could not give a live birth and have genetic disease are the users of this technology.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
People who want to do reproductions are banned to use this technology.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
It could create the copy of the individuals. It could be unsafe and affect people who have done the genome editing in the future.  

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
It could be developed having more fund on this technology and try to fix problems on human body. Not using it on people to reproductive, but to develop it and make it safer.


## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

After completing the assignment, I felt that we could make a change in everything we want to. It is not only in DNA, but also we can change rules or make changes between words in a statement. I would like to practice in a game that has rules in it. I can change whole game rules or specific words that came after they won or lost the game. It would be interesting to work on it. Additionally, if I want to change the data in the game that how much I scored or other people scored. I believe it would be different to make a change to data that is already stored. I can make the game so different than usual. It is one way to be an expert on data scientist and software engineer. In my opinion, it also could help students to be more interactive in the classroom and be helpful to practice what they have learned in class.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

One thing I am valued the most about the assignment is that I learned how to make a change in a stored data. Even though I was coding and adding the changes, it felt like somebody else is changing it. It was similar to creating an Artificial Intelligence my own. It was a great experience to see that I can actually code and do something that works in Java. I am so glad learning the capacity of computer science and what it can accomplish with these odd codes.
