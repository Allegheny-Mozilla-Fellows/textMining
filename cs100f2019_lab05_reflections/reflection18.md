## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: next integer
- `replace`: replace the character with another character
- `charAt`: the location of a character





## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest technical challenge that I faced was having my code select only one value. For example, after I did my code to change  random value, I was successful but every character after that one was changed. I overcame this by changing my line to a string and using a substring command. I wrote <.substring> in order to only select one character in my string to change. In addition, I used <.length> when I was creating my code for deleting a character, this substring allowed me to only delete one character. There were multiple technical challenges that I faced in this lab, but I was able to overcome them by being patient and trying my best to get the code to execute correctly.


## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?

  Researchers create genome editing technology through their work that is funded by stakeholders.

2.Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

  Parents that both carry homozygous dominant genes for polygenic disorders are prospective users of genome editing, so that their offspring does not have a genetic disorder. There are currently not many users of genome editing because it is not widely accepted in most cultures.

3.Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

   Users that use genome editing solely for the purpose of enhancing their genome are not supposed to use genome editing. This is due to the ethical issue that arises when only certain social classes have access to genome editing. Anyone that wants to use genome editing to harm another human being or to enhance their personal genes should not be using genome editing.

4.How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

   Genome editing can cause harm because it can create a class of people with elite genes. It also can cause genetic defects if it is not done correctly.

5.What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?

   Regulations that stop people from using genome editing for enhancement can avoid harm to other individuals. For example, in the U.S. the NIH will not fund gene editing in human embryos. There must be advocates that support regulations so that the people that do not have a voice in the debate will not feel the effects of the harm genome editing can cause.


## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I wish to practice problem solving more in the sense of computational thinking. My educational background does not involve computational thinking and this is a new skill for me. Therefore, I wish to practice coding more and learning more methods so I can apply my problem solving skills. I feel that any practice that I have more of will benefit me in the long run.


## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I value the experience of learning new coding methods. This lab was a challenge for me so I was forced to improve my skills and learn to code more efficiently. I am happy that I learned the replace method, such as when I replaced a letter with another random letter, <.replaceFirst>.
