The chosen DNA string is AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The complement is TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
Random Letter: A. Position: 9
Insertion: AAGTCTGGGACCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Random Letter: G. Position: 8
Deletion : AAGTCTGGACCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Random Letter: G. Position: 4. Letter replaced: T
New DNA string is AAGGCTGGACCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Thank You for using this program.
```

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: Scanning the next integer from the terminal.
- `random.nextInt`: To randomly select a position in you range(integer).
- `dna1.substring`: To add the rest of yourstring to the end where start at where your position letter stop.
## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
How to use a string method to find a random position replace with random method. I ask about the technical leader for using the specific methods to accomplition this requirement. eventhough there are a lot of confusion, the technical leader explain to me what is each step for and begin to start utilizing this method in this lab and during the process there will be alot of confusion weather I set the range properly and wheather it is inclusive or exclusive. However, I tried multiple times and made alot of adjustment to finished this task appropriately.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
American scientist Jennifer Doudna makes the genome editing technology.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Scientist are the user for the genome editing technology.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Non scientist not supposed to use the genome editing technology.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
The technique can cause big deletions or rearrangements of DNA.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
Base editors that alter specific DNA letters and nickases that do not completely sever the DNA. In addition using modified forms of CRISPR to control how active a gene is instead of directly altering a geneâ€™s DNA.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I want to practice more using the random and replace method and also using the string to randomly choose a position to replace with another letter. Finish these tasks was difficult. Sometimes you wrote it right. However, when you gradle run your program. the outcome was not quite match to what you expect. and especially when you set a range. It is difficult to remember where the number you set is inclusive or exclusive. I believe in the later class if we practice more, we will get more familiar with this. And will not be headache when we see this similar questions again.


## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I found out that, sometimes even though you wrote it correctly in your Atoms, but in the terminal the outcome was slightly different to the requiement of the questions. You will need to clearly see the output of your program and count the letters if the program really delete or add one letter to the DNA string. your outcome sometimes delete two letter or adding two more letter instead of one, which does not accomplish the requirements. So it is really important to see the out when you runs your program, even sometimes it sucessfully ran it. This not only provide the accuracy for the programmer but also trains a programmer to be more careful when doing other computer science assignments.
