Please enter the DNA String
Okay, I am going to manipulate the DNA string AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
This is complement 1: TTGTCTGGGCCTTTTTCCTGTTCTGGT
This is complement 2: AAGACAGGGCCAAAAACCAGAACAGGA
This is complement 3: AAGTGTGGGGGTTAATGGAGATGAGGA
This is complement 4: AACTCTCCCCCTTAATCCACATCACCA
A
This is complement 5: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAAGATCAGGA
The string with the deleted character is: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCGATCAGGA
This changes the position of one of the characters: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Thanks for using the ManipulateDna program.
Have an awesome day.

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: Returns the next pseudorandom, uniformly distributed int value from this random number generator's sequence.
- `toUpperCase`: changes input to all characters to upper case
- `charAt`: Returns the char value at the specified index.

## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

 the greatest technical challenge that I faced during this was figuring out the
 next step. Many times during this lab I would over thinking what I needed to do and
 end up making an extra couple steps which would end up back firing when I tried to run
 my program. I think I also struggled with making sure that my code's output was acutely
 did the action that I was trying to input, it was easier to make sure may coding worked
 but I had to double check that it actually was being affective.  


## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
    Genome editing is not a completely new technology but recently it has regained
    attention due to the discovery that CRISPR has the potential to make such
    editing more accurate and even "easy" in comparison to older technologies.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
    Genome editing and who should be the users of it raises a lot ethical issues
    however it is generally agree that until gremline genome editing is deemed
    safe through research, it should not be used for clinical reproductive purposes.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
    The issue that is most talked about is informed consent it is interesting to
    compare and look at the contrasts between genome editing and abortions. Some
    people worry that it is impossible to obtain informed consent because the
    "patients" affected by the edits are the embryo and future generations. However
    that parents already make many decisions that affect their future children.  

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
    Not only is this new technology that needs a lot more research and funding but
    it is also necessary to look at the justice and equity of the access and use
    of the technology. There is concern that genome editing will only be accessible
    to the wealthy and will increase existing disparities in social and/or economic
    class which would effect access to health care and other forms of mobility.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
    In general a safer way to experiment to find out more about genome editing
    gene editing should not be used for reproductive purposes. One thing many
    countries are doing is condition research only on embryos that are nonviable
    for birth.  

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
  After completing this assignment I would like to study the commands that we use.
  I think I need to study how the formatting and knowing what needs to be capitalized
  verses lower case.  I would also like to practice and continue to learn the command
  line code for terminal. In addition, memorizing more of java code so I can go
  about projects a little more efficiently. I would like to practice these tasks
  so that when I am completing projects I can do it without having to restart or
  do multiple things over again. I think a lot things have improved but I would still
  like for it to become habit so that I stop making silly mistakes. To answer the
  question of why basically just revolves around wanting to get a better and more efficient
  understanding of computer science

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
After completing this assignment, I think i valued slowing down and thinking things through
in lab I feel like I am constantly rushing to get the lab done that I do not think
through my process i have started to realized that this makes my lab take much longer because of
small issues that are easily fixable. This lab was hard for me to complete but i
think spreading it out over time and coming back to made it so that i could come
back with fresh eyes and fresh idea which was helpful with my problem solving
