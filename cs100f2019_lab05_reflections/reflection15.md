# Reflection by Isaiah Lucas

## Using a fenced code block, please display the output from running your program

```
DNA is AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
DNA cmplement is TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT

```

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: consetetur sadipscing elitr

  String str1 = dna.replace('A' , 't'); this replaces the A's to lowercase t's

## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest challenge to me was the fact of knowing what I am doing. I feel like the class is going so fast. I have not had any technology experience prior to this class and to be honest I am a little overwhelmed with everything. It looks like a different language to me and I feel like I am starting to get lost. I still need help on overcoming it, but we will get there.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
scientists and researchers
2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
NHGRI and the CRISPR
3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
The general public really because it would be used for the wrong reasons.
4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
It would be used to try to make "perfect babies" or try to enhance a person in some way besides therapy uses.
5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
Keep the editing regulated and out of reach of those that would use it for unethical purposes.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I want to practice more reading the gradle grade commands that it gives us when something goes wrong. When it gives me a list of stuff that is wrong with the program I am lost at to what those mean. The hardest part for me is knowing what it means and how to fix it. Mainly just the comprehension part of the gradle grade is what I need more help on. Also I also find it hard to understand if i need a system, int, or what in front of what i am about to do for a strig. I am good when it comes to a line but when it comes to what to put on the next string of commands that is when i get confused as well. Mainly I need help with my problem solving skills with computers.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
The one thing I have learned is what it means with replace statements. I understand that when it says replace, the first letter is what is being replaced and the second letter is what will be in the spot of the previous letter. I have valued that piece learning because I am not too bad at doing those and understand the principle of what is going on in the program. I am encouraged that i am making progress in that aspect because a couple weeks ago i would have had no clue what that was meant to do.
