I am going to manipulate the DNA string: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The complement string is: TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The insertion string is: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGAA
Deleting from position 7 gives: AAGTCTGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Inserting T at position 21 gives AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATTCAGGA

Thanks for using the ManipulateDNA program.

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `.nextInt`: uses a scanner to read in a string of characters and converts them into an int
- `.charAt`: identify a certain character in a string
- `.substring`: to declare the range of letter characters wanted


## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
I think that the hardest thing was declaring variables then keeping track of them. Since there were so many changes made to the original it was hard to keep changing the variable names and with each change you have to change the name of the variable. I kept getting confused and not making a new variable but then my build failed. However, sometimes I declared variables that didn't need to be declared. It took a lot of gradle builds/runs to make sure I was on the right track.


## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
National Human Genome Research Institute created CRISPER but they cannot take federal funds for research because the research creates/destroys embryos.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Currently the only approved area of research is gene therapy for people who need help treating disease by altering the patient's genetic material. It is not yet approved for reproductive health. Additionally, genome therapy is expensive and not covered by insurance because of it’s experimental nature so only people of a certain wealth can afford it.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Reproductive health is not supposed to have genome research done on it yet because the long term effects and all the consequences have not been ruled out so people cannot give complete informed consent.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
It can have off target effect and one error can be catastrophic effects especially when done on human. Also something I’ve learned about in a different class is the eugenics movement and this could contribute to this movement of attempting breed a healthier, “better” society.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
I think what researchers are doing now is good at not causing harm. Doing full research and not releasing such substantial treatment to humans before figuring out all side effects.


## After completing this assignment, what task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
Like I said before, one of the hardest things that I found in the project was declaring and keeping track of all my variable in the code. I think the more I practice creating new variable and the more I practice editing such variable I will do better at declaring new variable with different names and keeping track of the names as well. Additionally, I think that I have been doing well with things like the MadLibs which has to do a lot with declaring strings and println statement. When it comes to editing variable and math I struggle so I would like to practice those things more.


## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I think, as I say after almost every lab at this point, is that the labs have less and less original code already done for us so we have to contribute more and more to each project. The more I have to do on my own makes me learn the 'coding language' better and helps me understand what I am doing when coding (before I check by gradle running). After this lab I feel better about declaring variable and working with such variable to edit them the way my program requires. However, like I said before, I still want to practice it more because I still feel uncomfortable when creating programs with many variables.
