AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA  <- This is the original sequence.
TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT  <- This is the complement.
AAGTCTGGGCCTTCAATCCAGATCAGGA  <- This is inserted.
AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCAGATCAGGA  <- This is deleted.
AAGCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA  <- This is replaced.
Thank you for having looked at the DNA Sequence program!

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: Gets the next value integer.
- `new Random()`: preceded by the name of the object, new Random() generates a new random value to store as an object.
- `new Ray()`:

## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

I've said this many times that one of the greatest technical challenges as a new learner is trying to think about the newly introduced logical methods while also being responsible for executing them in the proper syntax. However, I noticed that this time around it took less time for me to figure out the various steps of the program when I practiced the strategy of writing in pseudocode and then reworking the ideas in the correct code language by looking at outside references. I once again did not have a team for this lab, though I thought it was meant to be independent and was definitely not as difficult as lab 4. The next challenge which had to be faced was how to pull a random letter between ATCG and use those in the first step of finding the complement. I ended up coming up with the strategy of taking 2 more new temporary letters as place holders and then including them in the final steps as swap commands to ensure that the other swapping systems would not undo themselves.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

Who makes the genome editing technology?

Biologists and researchers, though the technology has been banned in several countries for the time being.

Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

Currently no doctors/therapy methods use genome editing technology for people due to safety concerns. However, the researchers and scientists involved with creating and developing genome editing technology are also those that are technically using that technology.

Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

People can use genome editing technology as long as it is not used on research or for the purpose of reproduction and live embryos. To avoid the risks that may arise.

How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

There is a risk in using it for therapeutic reasons because there are imprecisions in targeting genes or imprecisions on how those genes may react. Also, there are ethical concerns that may cause harm in the sense of safety of individuals. There is also a public order harm potential that may arise with the development of revolutionary technologies that may provoke instability or uprising of the citizen body.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?

Before a research begins, it could be assigned a delegated group of officials in the government and other offices to make sure that nothing is done too hastily or in a manner that will cause public harm. If a groundbreaking discovery is made, it will be kept secret until it is assessed as safe to present to large crowds of people without it causing chaos.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

I want to continue practicing the creative writing of code so to solve everyday problems. It is an interesting thing to learn and it has an applicable use that adds to the satisfaction of it all.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

One learning experience that I have valued the most is being able to acquire knowledge in new languages such as code. I consider this computer science class to be a logic and language class more so than a coding class since it is something that has its own definitions and words and also its own ways of thinking. I am very grateful to getting better at understanding that because it expands my literacy overall.
