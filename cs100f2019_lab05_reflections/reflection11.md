The complementary DNA sequence is: TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The added nucleotide is: T at position: 8
The new DNA sequence is: TTCAGACCTCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The deleted char is: G at position: 9
The new DNA sequence is: TTCAGACCTGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The nucleotide T changed into C
The new DNA sequence is: CCCAGACCCGGAACCAGGCCCAGCCCC
Thank you for using our program!

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: shows that the input from the scanner or random function should be an integer
- `substring` : creates a substring within the parameters given to it
- `chatAt` : calls for a character at the specified location within a string

## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical difficulty that I faced while making this program is when inserting and deleting the nucleotides from the DNA sequence that was given to us. I did not know how to insert a specific character into a string and delete a character from a string because we did not learn how to do something like that specifically. At the end, I figured out that we can use the .substring command to break up the string however we want and put it back by either adding something in the middle of the breaks or removing something by skipping a character when reattaching the string.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
  The people who make genome editing technology can be software engineers who focus on making biological related programs and tools, or people who majored in Bioinformatics.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
  The people most likely to use genome editing technologies like this are scientists or researchers that are doing research or experimentation on DNA sequences.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
  People who would like to use this to bring harm to others. These may be people like terrorists trying to use the tool to spread chemical warfare that can harm the innocent.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
  People can use the genome editing tool to create biochemicals that are lethal. They can edit and manipulate DNA at their own will so the possibilities are endless, but one example can be that they can make a certain chemical that can target people with certain genotypes as they have specified.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
  We can try to manage who uses the powerful tools that can create the biomolecules that are designed by such programs. So even if people do design the harmful agents, they do not have a way of making them, because it will be almost impossible to control the programs themselves from being made, since anyone with the knowledge can make them. Another way can be to spread awareness and teach people about being responsible with technology. Technology has become a very integral part of life and is advancing at an incredible rate, so people should know how to use it properly and responsibly.


## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

The task I want to work on the most is being able to fully understand the different functions and codes we learn in class so that I can implement them in new and different situations. When I was trying to insert and delete characters into the DNA string, I was completely lost on how to do it. But I already learned what to use to accomplish the task, I just did not know how to do it. So I want to work on that the most so it does not take me as much time or effort to do this next time. I also want to work on being able to memorize and internalize the different codes that we learned. While doing this assignment, I found my self going back to my old labs to read some of the command line because I forgot how to use them. I feel like this is highly inefficient, so I would like to stop this habit and be able to write the basic codes without needing such assistance.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

I learned that I have different resources available to me when I am working on a program while in class. There are the technical leaders, the teacher, my peers and even online help. I leaned that I should properly use all the resources that are available for me so that I can be as optimal as I can be when making programs such as these.
