AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The DNA is: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The DNA string is TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The DNA sequence has an insertion mutation:
AAGTCTGGGCCTTAAATCCAGATCAGGA

The DNA sequence has an deletion mutation:
AAGTCTGGGCCTTATCCAGATCAGGA

The DNA sequence changes the position of a random DNA letter:
AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATAAGGA

Thank you for using this manipulation program!
```

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: returns a random number that ranges over all possible int values (positive and negative)
- `replace`: replaces each substring of this string that matches the literal target substring.
The substring matching process start from beginning of the string.
- `charAt`:  returns the character at the specified index

## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
I honestly can say the whole lab was a technical challenge for me mainly because of the complexity of the lab and
also there was a lot of work to be done. There was three different methods that needed to be done with the DNA string.
I realized that many of the different codes and functions in class would apply to this lab such as the charAt() function,
which we used to return certain characters in a certain string. The replace() method was also utilized so we could replace
certain characters to fit the requirements of the assignment.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
After reading the article, it seems like that genome editing technology was introduced
by the enhanced genome editing technology called CRISPR which many believes has the potential
to make such editing more accurate and even "easy" in comparison to older technologies.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Many scientists and bioethicists are the users of this genome editing technology
because they believe that those using for gene therapy are very ethical

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Scientists and also bioethicists acknowledge that in some cases, germline editing can address needs
not met by PGD (Preimplantation genetic diagnosis). This includes when both parents are homozygous for a disease-causing variant
(they both have two copies of the variant, so all of their children would be affected by the disease)
 and for families who object to some elements of the PGD process.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
Some researchers and bioethicists are  very concerned that any use of  genome editing, even for
the obvious therapeutic uses, will start the world on a constant need of  using it for non-therapeutic
and enhancement purposes, which can be viewed to many people as controversial.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
In this article, it states how many bioethical and research groups believe that research using gene editing in embryos
is important for several reasons, including to address unanswered scientific questions about human biology, as long
as it is not used for reproductive purposes at this time, which was emphasized throughout the article a tactic
that should be avoided.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I can see that I am not perfect with using the methods replace and length and I would love to see how
I can become better at those. It was challenging for me to understand what was really going on when
I utilized those methods and after much time and seeing what the output of the code was, I finally
started to understand what was truly going on. Besides that, I find using those methods very interesting
because you can easily manipulate a sentence with those methods and easily turn it into what you want.
It fascinates me a lot so I would love to practice more with the methods so I can better understand it
and utilize it in more programs in the future.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I learned how important patience and really reading the objective of an assignment is. Usually when I
am given an assignment, I jump right without really processing the reading material and that is what I did for this lab.
I can now realize the drastic mistake I made doing this. Without reading the material, I stood very confused and
very flustered that I could not figure out the lab and get the right input. I valued this learning experience
because it helped me realize how I was originally working on assignments was not correct.
