## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: the next integer that is provided in the
- `replace`: this selects the character that will be replaced when inputting the next code sequence
- `toUpperCase`: convert characters to all uppercase letters


## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest technical challenge that I faced during this lab was figuring out the different ways to manipulate the DNA. I was able to figure out, for the most part, how to do the first part where we had to come up with the complement of the DNA String. When it came to adding and making a character disappear it was a little tougher to understand the correct format that we were supposed to use. In order to overcome this challenge, I asked for help from the technical assistants in order to understand the process of how to solve these problems. They were able to give me examples so that I could understand how to make the code work which was helpful because it allowed me to see what I had to do rather than just skipping to the answer.


## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
The people making the genome editing technologies are researchers and bioethicists who want to give other scientists the ability to change an organism's DNA.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
The people using the genome editing technologies are people who want to help in the case of genetic diseases. It's the best opportunity for researchers to test the capabilities of our DNA.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
The idea of genome editing is so that people who have or are developing genetic diseases have an opportunity to possibly receive help when it comes to their disease. It also allows researchers to test the abilities of our DNA and genes and how they are able to test and see what is possible to edit or not. They should not be used for specific editing or gene enhancement unless it's going to benefit the health of the person or embryo.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
There is definitely some concern when it comes to safety and the damage that might come from gene testing. There is the risk of disease and disorders which can be affected by one or both genes being tested. There is also a worry that there is a slippery slope that could lead to its use not being for therapeutic and enhancement purposes.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
More testing and research is something that can always be done to avoid harm. They have been testing mainly on animals until enough research as been done to use human testing subjects or embryos. 

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
One thing that I would like to practice more is how to use the codes in the correct way. I can usually get them started and understand what I'm doing, but when I have to put them together is when I get confused the most. I would like to practice this more because it'd be beneficial when I was doing a lab so that I wouldn't get as confused and rely on the TA's help as much as I feel like I have been.


## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
One thing that I learned from completing this assignment is patience and just trying things, even if you think they won't work. One thing that gives me confidence to do coding is the ability to try things based off of work that I've done previously. After I've tried different methods and nothing works, that's usually when I ask for help. I do value the ability to go back and check on my other work to assist me when it comes to new projects I'm doing. It's something that helps me to continue to improve my ability to code and learn new ways to utilize the code.
