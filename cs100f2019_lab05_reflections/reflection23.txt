The DNA strand is ATGCTGAGTCAT
The compliment to the original strand is ATGGTGAGTGAT
The original strand will now have an 'T' added to it.
Your new strand is ATGCTGAGTCATT
With a random letter deleted the new strand is ATGCTGGTCAT
If you replace a random character the new strand it ATGCTGAGTCCT
Thank you for using the ManipulateDna program

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: generates a random integer, then moves output to the next line



## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?

  The greatest challenge that I faced during this assignment was figuring out how to add a random letter to a random slot in the DNA strand.  At first I was able to get a random letter selected, but I did not know how to place it in the DNA strand at a random location.  I looked through old assignments in order to try and see how we did it in the past, but I couldn't really find exactly what I was looking for.  So instead I decided to think outside of the box and use conditional logic, which we have not technically learned in class yet but I knew how to do and it helped me a lot on this assignment.  Due to the conditional logic I was able to make the random letter be placed in a random location with far less complex syntax than I would have had to use otherwise.  It might have been slightly lengthier in terms of the amount of code I had to physically type out, but the code was much more simple and I had a far easier time thinking about what to type, so the time it took me to complete it this way was significantly less than the alternative.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?


## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?

  This was an individual assignment, but a skill I would like to practice more would be conditional logic.  I know it wasn't really part of this assignment, but I used it and I know that it's one of the most fundamental concepts of programming and it is widely used to solve all sorts of programming problems.  I also really like using if and else if statement so I would like to do it more for enjoyment as well.  

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

  As in previous assignments, it was worthwhile to have to think about the logic behind the programming.  I always enjoy solving new problems with different types of solutions and using different programming concepts to get to those solutions.  If I just had to solve the same problem over and over and do it the same way I would get very bored very quickly.
