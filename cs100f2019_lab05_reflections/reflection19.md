Your DNA is: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Your DNA complement is: TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
The insertion DNA sequence at position 18 is: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAAGATCAGGA
A deletion mutation at position 2 gives: AATCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
A substitution mutation at position 10 gives: AAGTCTGGGCGCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
Thank you for using the ManipulationDna Program.

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: scans the next token of input as an int
- `substring`: returns a new string that is a sub string of the given string
- `charAt`: returns the character at the specified index of the string


## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
The greatest difficulty I experienced was organizing the commands to insert, delete,
and substitute nucleotides into the sequence. This trouble came from determining
what commands to use and how to use them. To overcome this, I did a general search
of the web for how it can be done. This helped me organize the order of my commands
and what commands to use. Also, it took a lot of trial and error to get everything
correct so it would give me the correct output. Another challenge I had was with
spacing. I kept having build errors that had something to do with spacing and going
past so many characters on a single line. Again, this was just trial and error to
overcome, along with looking at what lines were causing the build error.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
Many world leaders such as the US, UK, and China. Scientist design CRISPR to target
specific genes for editing.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Currently, researches are the users of genome editing technology. They are trying
to find a safe, ethical, and effective way to edit genes.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Currently, it is not supposed to be used for clinical reproductive purposes. Research
that creates or destroys embryos can not be funded federally.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
There can be an off-target effect and mosaicism that cause harm, because the genes
were not edited correctly. As well, there is concern this could divide people, as
the wealthy could afford to have genes edited and the possibility of enhanced genes.
Also, there is the question of consent for germline therapy.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
More research can be done to make CRISPR safer in the aspect that it does not have
an off-target effect. A solution for it only being accessible to the wealthy could
be finding a way to make it cheaper or having insurance or programs cover the costs.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I would like to review commands. I am still having trouble remembering commands
not used super often. I have trouble remembering how they are used and exactly what
they do. I would also like to explore more ways commands could be used. The reason
I would like to practice this more is because this has been giving me difficulty
over most the labs. Also, I would like to understand the spacing used in code. Why
do you have to tab some commands in but not other commands. I believe it means it
is a part of the previous command when tabbed in past it, but I would like to know
for sure.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I enjoyed how this can apply to other fields of science like biology. I am a biochemistry
major, so I liked seeing how a program can simulate changes to DNA sequences and
tell you what the mutation was and where the mutation was. I think programs like
this could/are useful for other fields of science. Also, I enjoyed the article.
It is on the subject I am doing my senior research on.
