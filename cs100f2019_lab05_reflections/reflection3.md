## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `Random`: Declares a random variable
- `replace`: replaces a certain variable, or certain spot in a word with another
character.
- `String`: A type of variable/expression used to display characters.



## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
  The greatest challenge I faced when when doing this lab was to actually get the program working. I spent a lot of time trying to fix things that were hindering my program from working and I still couldn't get it to work. It seemed no matter what I tried the program just refused to run or build. I have been trying to overcome by looking through the past programs, and lecture notes from class.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?

The genome editing technology is created by computer scientists, along with the
help of bioethicists, as well as other biologists.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?

The users of genome editing technology are scientists that are trying to change
the DNA of an embryo that has potential of having various diseases that both parents
could pass on.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?

The every day common person should not use genome editing technology.

4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?

The genome editing technology can cause harm by messing up the original genome in a way that can't be fixed that could be detrimental by whoever/whatever is being operated on by either making edits in the wrong place, or making it so only some of the cells have it.

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?

The first solution is to make sure that genome manipulation is almost completely safe before any sort of clinical trials are put into action. Obviously there is no way it can ever be 100% safe because almost all medical procedures have a little bit of risk involved, but to make it so it is almost always safe would be the best bet. Another way to avoid harm is to inform whoever is having the genome manipulation done what the risks are, and what the outcome should be.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
The task i want to practice more is the using the replacing command. The problem with my program is that it's not wanting to replace the certain letter of the DNA code with another letter for a reason I could not decipher, and I tried to do it all on my own instead of going to a technical leaders office hours and getting help. I will know not to make that mistake, so asking for help is another task that I want to practice more.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?

The one experience i have valued the most is the time I spent struggling on this lab alone. With this experience I have realized that I can not do everything in this class on my own even though up to this point I have without much help. Through realizing this I believe it will help me ask for help, so I can further understand some of the concepts that we have discussed that I have obviously not as much of a grasp on as I thought I did.
