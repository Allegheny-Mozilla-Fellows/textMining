The DNA sequence is: AAGTCTGGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
The complement sequence is: TTCAGACCCGGAATTAGGTCTAGTCCT
A random insert is: AAGTCTGGTGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
A random deletion is: AAGTCTGGCCTTAATCCAGATCAGGA
A random replacement is: AAGTCTGGGCCATAATCCAGATCAGGA
Thank you!
```

## For each String and Random method used, add an explanation in the list format (as shown in an example below).

- `nextInt`: takes the next integer until the first white space
- `charAt`: takes a character at a given location as an object
- `substring`: takes a section of a string at given character locations
- 'length' : counts how many characters are in a string
- 'replace' : for every given character a new character supplants it

## What was the greatest technical challenge that your team faced and how did you overcome it?
I had the most trouble with the replacement. I tried to use the .replace method. However, I could only get the program to run if I used only characters. That would mean I had to replace every single A, T, G or C in the string rather than one individual. To fix this I broke my dna string in to sub strings and compiled in random letters. For deletions I did a similar process accept I made the sub string smaller.

## Based on your experiences with simple DNA manipulation in this lab and reflecting on the assigned article, answer the following questions:

1. Who makes the genome editing technology?
computer scientist, biochemists, bioethicists are all needed to make genome editing technology.

2. Who are the users of the genome editing technology?
Currently its mostly researchers and the agriculture industry as the technology has not been widely ethically tested for medical uses. Some point soon, Parents can use gnome editing to alter cancer related genes in their future children.

3. Who is not supposed to use the genome editing technology?
Everyone who has not been approved by an ethics committee. As most ethicists agree we don't have enough information on how genome editing affects humans. Human testing does not get approved by ethics committees. Any anyone underqualified should stay out of labs.
4. How can the genome editing technology cause harm?
Because genome editing happens in embryos it only happens to those who cannot consent. Or if for some reason a researcher does go on and decide to try gene editing to prevent HIV with out approval, there is no way of knowing how those kids will grow up. Will the editing have any unintended consequences?

5. What solutions can be developed to avoid the harm caused by the genome editing technology or to fix the harm?
The ethics committees have been mostly effective. Journals can refuse to publish work for papers that do not meet the ethical criteria. Grants could be reserved until an ethics committee shows approval.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that your team wants to practice more? Why?
I would like to practice with the .replace. I had trouble figuring out how to not replace every A or every T.

## After completing this assignment, what is one learning experience you have valued the most?
I am glad I took intro to biochem last semester. I feel like I had a solid understanding on the concepts of base pairs.
